i want to create a web app using nextjs and tailwind where i will have admin, employees and customers. This will be an interactive app for renting games such as scrabble and chess and card games. The games will have qr codes attached to them and the qr will store the name of the game and the branch it will be at. The employee will scan a game for a customer and a timer will start. There will be employees in different locations and they will be assigned in their branches. Once the employee scans a game for a customer a timer will start. The game xosts 3 bob a minute and when stopped it will display the total time taken plus the total cost. The employee will see al the revenue he or she has collected in hisbranch. He will be able to pause and stop a timer for a customer. The customer will also be able to scan a game for himself and see the countdown and pause the timer but it will auto continue after 20 minutes break. After stopping he will see the total cost to pay. the admin will see the total revenue for all employees, how an employee is performing, the active rentals and charts will be implemented in the dashboard. I want all this to be achieved and add various inputs that i have left.
This a summary of what i want:
